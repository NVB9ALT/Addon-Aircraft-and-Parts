# Addon-Aircraft-and-Parts

**YOU MUST RUN THE REALISM PACK BEFORE LOADING THIS ADDON,** as the function used for placing the models is in the Realism Addon.</br>
To run the addon, copy and paste main.js into the console.<br>
** ***Paddle switch/Cobra button:***   ***"*** (your apostrophe/quotation mark) **

These aircraft are not animated, so features like landing gear, cockpits, and afterburner use separately loaded models that may be left behind floating in midair when toggling these features.

NOTE: some new addon aircraft **might be broken or glitchy**.

Current features:
- F/A-18C addon aircraft. Does have a tailhook. Has paddle switch.
- Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker addon aircraft. Slightly different from the Su-35 due to the inclusion of a speedbrake, lack of thrust vectoring, and weaker engines. Will probably add a proper, gauge-filled Su-27 cockpit at some point. Has Cobra button.
- MiG-17 addon aircraft.
- E-7 Wedgetail addon aircraft.
- MiG-21 addon aircraft. X key toggles WEP/drop tank, with the tank on max power is standard AB, with the tank off max power is WEP thrust.
- Morane-Saulnier Type G addon aircraft.
- Lockheed F-117 addon aircraft. Does NOT have stealth.
- F-14A Tomcat. Differs from the F-14B due to a more accurate flight model and weaker engines (unless you go faster than Mach 1.75, at which point the engines get a lot more powerful - just like the real F-14A). Is prone to flat spins.

Aircraft to be probably added in the future:</br>
- Su-33 addon aircraft. Will include folding wing animation and tailhook. (This will likely be released pretty close to the time the F/A-18C gets its tailhook).
- Eurofighter Typhoon/Dassault Rafale
- Cessna Citation
- Tupolev Tu-144
